# Razer Gold Refund Process Guide

This guide outlines the standard operating procedure for handling refund requests.

## Step 1: Initial Assessment of the Refund Request

When a customer requests a refund, the first step is to determine the nature of the transaction.

1.  **Check the Merchant and Payment Method:**
    *   **Is the merchant Tencent and was the payment made using Razer Gold (RG)?**
        *   **Yes:** A refund is possible, but it must be initiated by Tencent, not by Razer Gold. Proceed to their process.
        *   **No:** Proceed to the next step.

## Step 2: Handling General Refund Requests

For all other merchants and payment methods, the standard policy applies.

1.  **Standard Response:**
    *   If the customer is simply requesting a refund and the item was delivered, respond with the standard policy: "Unfortunately, all transactions on the Razer Gold platform are final and cannot be reversed."

2.  **Item Not Delivered:**
    *   If the customer paid but the item was not delivered, the handling depends on how the request was received.

## Step 3: Specific Scenarios for Non-Delivered Items

### A. Request via CA Ticket

*   **Action:** Suggest to the customer that they top up their Razer Gold wallet with the equivalent amount. They can then use this balance to purchase other items.

### B. Request via WeChat (or similar platforms)

1.  **Involve Business Development (BD):** Pull the appropriate BD personnel into the conversation.
2.  **Request a Credit Note:** The BD team should request a credit note.
3.  **Suggest Manual Item Provision:** As an alternative, suggest that the merchant manually provides the item to the customer, especially if the transaction is confirmed as successful on the Razer Gold side (payout.dbo.payments.mpaymentstatusId = 2). If the merchant agrees, the case is closed.
4.  **Negotiation:** If the merchant cannot or will not resend the item and still insists on a refund (similar to the PearlAbyss case), the BD team must negotiate a resolution. This is handled as a business operations issue.

### C. Exceptional Cases

*   If the situation does not fit the above scenarios, escalate the issue.
*   **Action:** Please check with the local team and/or the payment team to explore alternative solutions.
